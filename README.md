RECOMMENDATION

 

Songs with multiple artist collaborations, such as “Se Le Ve” and “Los del Espacio,” which feature 8 artists, demonstrate the appeal of collective star power. Collaborating with a diverse range of artists, especially from different genres or regions, can broaden the song’s reach and attract a wider audience.

 

Artists like The Weekend, Taylor Swift, and Ed Sheeran dominated the top of the charts, highlighting their strong fanbases. I recommend that all new artist could collaborate with established figures or through creative remixing of their hits, as seen with "Mine (Taylor's Version)."

 

The analyisis shows the preference for songs in major modes, with 3 million+ streams, indicates a general audience leaning towards upbeat or positive-sounding tracks. However, minor mode songs also accumulated nearly 2 million play. I suggest should be tailored to this  music production to these patterns could enhance listener engagement.

 

The album release trend shows that 2022 had the highest number of releases on the charts. Planning album launches during high-streaming periods could improve chart performance, while releasing during less saturated periods could ensure greater visibility and longevity on playlists.

 

Songs at the bottom of the charts, such as “Still With You” and “Don’t Ever Say Love Me (feat. RM of BTS),” could benefit from increased marketing efforts or strategic placement in high-traffic Spotify playlists to enhance visibility and engagement.
